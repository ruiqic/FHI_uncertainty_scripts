# FHI uncertainty scripts
Scripts used for uncertainty quantification for ML-based interatomic potentials.
This repo is created to collect some useful functions that have been used.

Note: these functions have been modified to suit more general use. However, they have not been rigorously tested, so there may be bugs, but should be straightforward to fix
